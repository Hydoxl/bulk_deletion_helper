# How to use:
## dumpallmessages.py & dumpmessagesbyyear.py
Place it in your package directory and run
## dumpchannelids.py & duplicatechecker.py & blacklistdumpchannelids.py
Have a .txt full of existing channel ids in your package/messages directory in this format:

```
1234567890123456
1234567890123456
1234567890123456
1234567890123456
```

Place the file in your package directory and run (optional for duplicatechecker.py)

Specify the .txt filename while execution and make sure it's in the same path as the script.
